# Challenge 2 - Professional Portfolio
For this challenge, I am creating a professional portfolio for potential employers to view.

# Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
